# IMPLEMENTATION-OF-KNN-BASED-DROWSINESS-DETECTION-USING-JETSON-NANO
This project focuses on developing a real-time driver drowsiness detection system using the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm implemented on the NVIDIA Jetson Nano. The system leverages computer vision to monitor the driverâ€™s eye status and detect signs of drowsiness, helping to reduce the risk of accidents due to fatigue.
